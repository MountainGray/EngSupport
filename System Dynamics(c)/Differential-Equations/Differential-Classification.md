# Differential Classification

The classification of a differential equation can follow this flowchart

## Order

The order of a equation is determined by the highest power derivitive in the equation

$y''x + 32y' =23x$ is a second order differential since it has $d^2y\over dx$

## ODE vs PDE

ODE or PDE is determined by the ammount of independant variables the equation has.

## Implicit vs Explicit

Implicit equations are given as 

$F(...)=0$

Explicit equations are given in a form with values on the right side of equals

$F(...)={d^ny\over dt^n}$

## Linear Equations

with a given form of ODE below 

$a_n(t){d^ny(t)\over dt^n}+a_{n-1}{d^{n-1}y(t)\over dt^{n-1}}+...+a_1(t){dy(t)\over dt}+a_0(t)y(t)=f(t)$

If none of the coefficients **a** are functions of the dependent variable, the equation is linear

Example

$x'' + 2x' + 5x=sin(t)$ is linear

$({dx(t)\over dt})^2+4{dx(t)\over dt}=0$ is not linear

## Homogeneous Equations

When f(t)=0, the equation is homogeneous
