# Module 2 Thermodynamic properties of a pure substance

## Common properties

### Pressure

Normal force exerted by an object on a surface per unit area of the surface

$P=F/A$

Units: Pascal $Pa=N/{m^2}$ or kilo-Pascal $kPa=kN/m^2$

### Temperature

### Density

Mass per unit volume

$\rho = m/V$

Units: $kg/m^3$

### Specific Volume

volume per unit mass

$v=V/m=1/\rho$

Units: $m^3/kg$

## Internal Energy and Specific internal energy

Internal energy - the some of kinetic and potential energies of the collections of all molecules in a system

Internal energy is a form of thermal energy since it is strongly associated to temperature

They are important for **Closed Systems**

## Enthalpy and specific enthalpy

Combines *U\ P* and $V$

Enthalpy per unit mass of substance

Specific enthalpy: $h=u+Pv$,   $h=H/m$

Units: J/kg, kJ/kg
