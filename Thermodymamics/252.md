# 252 Thermodynamics

## Table master (under construction! not added yet)

Py program to take in P and T and give out all the values from given tables, or maybe more?

* build in linear appx
* find state for P or T and one value of v, u, h, or s
* calculate values from quality

## Overview

The course is divided into ~6 Modules

1. State, Processes and Systems
2. Thermodynamic properties of a pure substance
3. Ideal Gas
4. The First Law of Thermodynamics for Closed Systems
5. The First Law of Thermodynamics for Open Systems
6. The Second Law of Thermodynamics for Closed Systems
7. The Second Law of Thermodynamics for Open Systems

I will also compose my own cheat sheet alongside the provided one for this course
