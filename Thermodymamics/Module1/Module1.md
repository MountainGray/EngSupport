### The First Law of Thermodynamics

Energy is conserved; it can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only change forms.

### The Second Law of Thermodynamics

A process always occurs in the direction of decreasing the quality of energy.
In any process $S_{gen}>0$.
Ex. In heat engines, not all available heat can be converted to useful work.

### Systems

* Closed system: - Fixed mass, energy can enter and leave
* Open system: Controlled Volume, energy and mass can enter and leave
* Isolated system: No mass & energy can leave

#### Properties

A system's properties can be divided into two categories, Extensive and Intensive

##### Extensive Properties

Extensive properties are dependant on the mass of a system

##### Intensive Properties

Independent of the mass of the system

* $m$ Mass Extensive
* $V$ Volume - Extensive, $v$ Specific Volume - Intensive
* $U$ Internal Energy - Extensive, $u$ Specific Internal Energy
* $T$ Temperature - Intensive
* $P$ Pressure - Intensive
* $H$ Enthalpy - Extensive, $h$ Specific Enthalpy - Intensive
* $S$ Entropy - Extensive, $s$ Specific Entropy - Intensive

### Cycles

* Isobaric - Pressure is constant
* Isochoric - Specific volume remains constant
* Isothermal - Temperature is constant
* Adiabatic - No heat transfer between system and surroundings
* Isentropic - Entropy remains constant
