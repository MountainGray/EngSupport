# EngSupport

A public source for all the notes and cheat sheets I made for engineering, help yourself!

I am starting this project right before exams, so right now I do not have a lot of material and structure yet, but I'm going to get there. I intend to put up pdf versions of cheat sheets, sample code and more as I progress.

## Important sections

[Numerical Methods Functions](https://github.com/MountainGray/EngSupport/tree/main/Numerical-Methods(c)/Functions) contains all the matlab functions I made for 256, feel free to use these instead of doing the work by hand

## How to use md documents

Most of my cheat sheets/notes are in markdown, this means that viewing them in gh wont render the equations since they are laytex in md, all the notes should be converted to a word docx or PDF by pandoc, easy and simple, then they can be edited from there if you want to add fancy stuff

If you are afraid of markdown then just use the docx or pdf's
